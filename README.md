# Password Manager Access for .NET in C#

Provides access API to various online password managers. This repo is an
attempt to join and unify all the libraries I've written in the past (see
detunized/lastpass-sharp, detunized/1password-sharp and many more).

**This is work in progress and will be for a while.**
